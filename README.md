# CS 330 Final Project – 3D Scene and Design Reflection

This repository contains the final project for CS 330: Computational Graphics and Visualization. It includes the Design Decisions document, source files for the 3D scene, and a reflection on the development process.

## Project Files

- **Design Decisions Document** – Explains the process of translating a 2D reference into a 3D environment, including object modeling, texturing, lighting, and camera controls.
- **Source Files** – Code, shaders, and supporting assets for the 3D scene.

## Reflection

### 1. How do I approach designing software?
- This project taught me to break complex designs into **simple, reusable primitives**. For example, a yoga block was modeled as a box, candles as capped cylinders, and a mat as a rotated cylinder 
- I developed skills in **balancing realism with efficiency** by using textures and lighting instead of unnecessary polygons.  
- My design process emphasized **modularity**: keeping each object under 1,000 triangles while layering textures and lighting to enhance realism.  
- In future projects, I can apply this approach by **prioritizing efficiency and modularity**, ensuring systems remain both scalable and visually convincing.

### 2. How do I approach developing programs?
- I incorporated **iteration and testing** at each stage, starting with basic geometry, then layering textures, and finally adding lighting and camera navigation.  
- I adopted strategies like **Phong shading** for realistic lighting and **projection toggles** (orthographic vs. perspective) to improve usability.  
- Over the milestones, my coding evolved from writing single-purpose scripts to structuring the project into **maintainable modules**. This not only improved readability but also made debugging easier.  
- Iteration played a major role, as each refinement cycle let me validate geometry, textures, and navigation features.

### 3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
- **Educational pathway**: Computational graphics deepened my understanding of **OpenGL, shader programming, and camera systems**, all of which build a stronger foundation for advanced CS courses.  
- **Professional pathway**: These skills translate directly into **software engineering and visualization roles**, where efficiency, modularity, and interactive design are essential.  
- The project demonstrated how computer science equips me to **translate abstract ideas into functional, interactive systems**, a critical skill in both technical and creative industries.
